# ModelRunner üöÄ

Welcome to `ModelRunner`! This package is designed to make your machine learning model evaluations easier and more streamlined. Whether you're running classification models, regression models, or visualizing decision trees, `ModelRunner` has got you covered.

## Features üåü

- **Versatile Model Evaluations**: Run various ML algorithms with multiple hyperparameters and obtain predictions, scores, and feature importances.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles label encoding for your categorical data.
- **Visualizations**: Get confusion matrix heatmaps and detailed decision tree visualizations with customizable zoom levels.

## Installation üì¶

You can install `ModelRunner` directly from my GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/hamid-shojaei/modelrunner.git
```

For additional SVG functionalities, you can install the optional dependency `cairosvg`:

```bash
pip install modelrunner[svg]
```

## How to Use üõ†
Basic Model Evaluation
Initialize the ModelEvaluator with your data and desired models:

```python
from modelrunner import ModelEvaluator

hyperparameters = {
    "classification_tree": {
        "algorithm": "DecisionTree",
        "max_depth": 3
    }
}

evaluator = ModelEvaluator(X, y, hyperparameters)
evaluator.run_models()
```

Retrieve predictions, feature importances, and more!

```python
predictions = evaluator.get_predictions("classification_tree")
feature_importances = evaluator.get_feature_importances("classification_tree")
```

## Advanced Visualizations
Visualize your decision trees:

```python
tree_graph = evaluator.visualize_tree("classification_tree")
```

Adjust the size of your decision tree SVG visualization:

```python
from modelrunner.utils import display_svg_with_zoom_v5

display_svg_with_zoom(tree_graph, width_zoom_percent=50, height_zoom_percent=70)
```
